# Rendering Engine
My first rendering engine, and first c++ project.
Will possibly serve as bedrock for physics engine in the future.

## TODO
- Add fullscreen/pause/resume
- Create scenes and UI to switch between them
- Recreate without the help of visual studio (it is bothering me)

## Sources
- Making heavy use of TheCherno's OpenGL series:
