# Rendering Engine
My first rendering engine, and first c++ project.

## TODO
- Add time/pause/resume
- Ability to swap between (UI to switch between them)
- Remove reliance on Visual Studio for compilation

## GOALS
- Scenes
- Primitive 3d shapes
- Importing models/scenes
- Abstraction of render texture (dissasociation between screen and rendering)
- Upgraded uniform handling (parsing the shader file procedurally)
- Abstraction over camera
- Global illumination
- Other illuminations

## Sources
- Making heavy use of TheCherno's OpenGL series:
